# Intro

## Introduction

Microsoft Office is the most widely used office suite for a number of years now, mostly due to relative easy learning curve and  initial flexibility.

Today I am going to discuss  few diff tools that you can use to carry out some of Microsoft Office tasks. The aim behind this talk is to address the balance between those two statements:

* Change for the sake of change is rarely a sensible use of time.
* Tools have to fit the purpose.

Before I wenture any further I would like to discuss topic that seems a bit unrelated, that is Word vs Latex discusion.

## Lx vs Word



A common conception is that Latex is predominantly of academic use, due to a steep learning curve, and while it handles complex equation and big documents well, it fares poorly when comparing the writing efficiency, especially when the grammar is considered.
Latex users argument can be presented in  a simple graph as

Microsoft Office user argument would be the first sentence and highligh of how easy it is to start

Academic use paragim, a steep learning curve and compex syntax even lead to [a academic paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069). Discussion of any other tools, has to address those comments as well.


## Take a step back

So before I progress any further in this discussion I would like to bring attention to my second sentence. Let's ask some questions:

* what is the main goal of my work?
* what is the most productive use of my time?
* what is the added value that I bring to the table?
* how much control do I want over the deocuments I produce? How much data fidelity do I require?
* how often do I need to change document following commentd?

* what is more important for me? The visuals or the content?
* how often do I need to change content of my presentation?
* how much animation ect do I need in my presentation?
* how much interaction is required with my report? Do I need to verify the findings, change the report?

## Discussion

## Deep Thinking concept

## What tools do we discuss here

With this gone, lets focus on discussing the tools that I am suggesting on using.


## Report example

## Pp example

discuss how to do it


## Why do I suggest this

Change for the sake of change is rarely a sensible use of time

* distraction free work
* automatisation
* version control
* flexiblity
* ect
